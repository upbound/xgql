  Valid examples:

  * `metadata.name`
  * `spec.containers[0].name`
  * `data[.config.yml]`
  * `metadata.annotations['crossplane.io/external-name']`
  * `spec.items[0][8]`

  * `spec.containers[*].args[*]` - Supports wildcard expansion.

  Invalid examples:

  * `metadata.name.` - Trailing period.
  * `spec.containers[]` - Empty brackets.
  * `spec.containers.[0].name` - Period before open bracket.

  For an object with the following data:

  ```json
